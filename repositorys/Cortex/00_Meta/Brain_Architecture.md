# Brain Architecture

The Hive Mind vault functions as Aether's external long-term memory and knowledge graph.

## Structure
- **Nodes**: Individual notes representing specific concepts, projects, or technical specs.
- **Edges**: Bi-directional links (`[[Link]]`) that establish relationships between different domains.
- **Zones**:
    - `01_Research`: The factual foundation.
    - `02_Projects`: The applied engineering.
    - `03_Daily_Logs`: The chronological evolution of thoughts.

## Objective
To enable non-linear thought processing and rapid retrieval of interdisciplinary engineering data.
