# Operational Security (OPSEC) & Anonymity

This node establishes the protocols for maintaining the anonymity of Rambeau and Aether.

## Identity Protocols
- **Rambeau**: Publicly represented by a digital avatar/persona (e.g., The Architect, Mark I). No real name, location, or biometric data.
- **Aether**: Publicly represented as an autonomous agent. Technical details shared, but server locations and hardware specifics are redacted.
- **Location**: Base of operations (Morocco) is obscured. Communication routed through secure gateways.

## Secure Communication
- **Public (Twitter)**: Highly curated, sentiment-neutral or brand-specific voice.
- **Private (WhatsApp/HiveMind)**: Full disclosure, but isolated from public-facing nodes.

## Data Sanitization
- Before any script or tech stack is shared as a "Lead Magnet," all local paths, API keys, and identifiers must be stripped.

## Tasks
- [ ] Research best practices for building an anonymous digital authority.
- [ ] Establish a "Sanitization Script" in the Forge.
